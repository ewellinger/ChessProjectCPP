# ChessProjectCPP
Chess Project in C++

Initially started this project in C and later adapted it in C++.  Currently the movement of pieces is all working but I still haven't gotten checkmate down.  In trying to code checkmate I ran into a bug where the king will disappear if put into check.  

It's been quite a while since I've messed with this code, I'm considering trying to restart this project in Python since I haven't used C++ in a good while now.  If I do, I'm going to see if I can incorporate Huffman encoding to encode the chessboard and maybe link it to a database with chessboard layouts.  That way it could just look to that database to see if the board is in a state of checkmate or not.
